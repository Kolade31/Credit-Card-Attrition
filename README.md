# Credit-Card-Attrition
A supervised learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn or not.
## Introduction 
Customer churning (or customer attrition rate) is a problem for any business in the service industry, you only make money by keeping customers interested in your product. In the financial service industry this usually takes the form of credit cards and so the more people that use their credit card service, the more money they will make. Being able to determine which customers are the most likely to drop their credit card and by extension, be able to reach out to those customers before they drop the card to fix their problem. This could give the bank a competitive advantage in the marketplace by keeping more customers using their credit card over their competitors. 
## Problem Statement
In this project, a bank manager is disturbed by the fact that more and more customers leaving their credit card services. We would try to tackle this problem by creating a supervised learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn or not. This model can help the manager to lower customers' churn rate by giving special attention to customers that are expected to churn.
## Description of Data Source and Tools used
